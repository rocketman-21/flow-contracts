# L1 Proof of Concept - Offchain Library

This offchain library is part of a proof of concept for generating and verifying Ethereum L1 state proofs. It is inspired by and builds upon the work done in the [state-proof-poc](https://github.com/wilsoncusack/state-proof-poc) project by Wilson Cusack.

## Acknowledgements

Special thanks to [Wilson Cusack](https://github.com/wilsoncusack) for the original implementation and inspiration. This project extends and adapts concepts from the [state-proof-poc](https://github.com/wilsoncusack/state-proof-poc) repository.

## Purpose

This library provides functionality for working with Ethereum state proofs in an offchain context. It includes utilities for generating and verifying proofs, as well as interacting with Ethereum nodes to retrieve necessary data.

## Getting Started

To use this library, make sure you have the required dependencies installed as specified in the `package.json` file.

For more detailed information on the original concept and implementation, please visit the [state-proof-poc](https://github.com/wilsoncusack/state-proof-poc) repository.

## Installation and Running

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   bun install
   ```

2. Copy the `.env.example` file and add your configuration:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Then edit the `.env` file to add your specific configuration.

3. Run the application:
   ```
   bun index.ts
   ```

This will execute the main script and demonstrate the functionality of the offchain library.
